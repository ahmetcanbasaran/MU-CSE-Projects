Notes

    You can leave the preamble and access code fields blank in the packet encoder and packet decoder blocks, and default values will be chosen automatically.
    If you create your own access codes (like I do in this example), the packet encoder and packet decoder codes must match perfectly for the decoder to pass the data (this is obvious).
    If you create your own access codes, you must choose long codes. I experimented with different access code lengths and the encoder/decoder blocks just don't work for short codes. I don't know the magic number of bits you need for the access codes, but if it is not working for you, try a longer code!
    I included a scope in the flow graph above to confirm that the File Source was indeed sending the correct bits. For example, I created a source text file, wich included just the letter "h". Then I observed that, indeed, the file was sending the expected ASCII 1's and 0's pattern for the letter "h".
